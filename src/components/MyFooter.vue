My professional experience, gained as an agency owner for 7 years, and as a dedicated eCommerce developer for the last 3 has given me a great perspective and the ability to adapt, solve problems and prioritise good communication. I am motivated by web performance and the experience of the end-user and Iâ€™m always keen to learn more to drive my skillset in this fast-moving field. Outside of work, I love to play with my 4-year-old daughter and I attempt to stay healthy running and cycling.'
